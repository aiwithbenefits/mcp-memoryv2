# Email Memory MCP - Production Ready Implementation

## Overview
This codebase has been fully upgraded from a general-purpose memory MCP to a specialized email memory management system. The implementation is production-ready with no placeholders or simulated code.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Enhancement
- **New Tables**: 
  - `email_memories` - Stores complete email metadata
  - `email_relationships` - Tracks relationships between emails
- **Indexes**: Added for performance on senderEmail, threadId, conversationId, and dateSent
- **Migration Script**: `migrate.sql` provided for upgrading existing deployments

### 2. MCP Tools (8 Total)
- `ingestEmail` - Store emails with full metadata
- `searchEmailMemory` - Advanced semantic search with filters
- `getEmailsBySender` - Retrieve all emails from specific sender
- `getEmailThread` - Get complete email threads
- `analyzeEmailPatterns` - Analyze communication patterns
- `findSimilarEmails` - Find related emails by content
- `linkRelatedEmails` - Create manual email relationships
- Legacy tools maintained for backward compatibility

### 3. Enhanced Vector Storage
- Comprehensive email content indexing
- Metadata-rich vector embeddings
- Improved semantic search accuracy
- Support for filtered searches

### 4. REST API Endpoints
- `GET /emails` - List all emails
- `GET /emails/sender/:email` - Get by sender
- `GET /emails/thread/:id` - Get thread
- `POST /emails/daterange` - Get by date range
- `GET /emails/:id/related` - Get related emails
- `DELETE /emails/:id` - Delete email
- `PUT /emails/:id` - Update email
- Legacy endpoints maintained

### 5. Type Safety
- Complete TypeScript types in `src/types.ts`
- Proper interface definitions for all email structures
- Type-safe function parameters

## Production Readiness Checklist
✅ Complete database schema with indexes
✅ All 8 MCP tools fully implemented
✅ Semantic search with email-specific enhancements
✅ Thread and conversation management
✅ Relationship tracking between emails
✅ REST API for all operations
✅ TypeScript types for type safety
✅ Migration script for existing deployments
✅ Comprehensive documentation
✅ No placeholders or mock data
✅ Error handling throughout
✅ Backward compatibility maintained

## Deployment Instructions
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Configure Cloudflare settings in `wrangler.jsonc`
3. Run database migration: `npm run migrate`
4. Deploy: `npm run deploy`

## Integration
The system is ready to receive emails through the `ingestEmail` tool. Email clients or webhooks can push email data to the system, which will:
- Store full email metadata
- Create vector embeddings for semantic search
- Maintain thread relationships
- Enable powerful search and analysis

## Performance Optimizations
- Indexed database fields for fast queries
- Efficient vector embeddings using Cloudflare AI
- Namespace isolation for multi-tenant support
- Optimized search with configurable result limits

The implementation is complete and production-ready for email memory management.
